## Installation
**ONLY FOR EPIC GAMES, NOT STEAM**
1.  Install Melonloader using the [install guide](https://hemisemidemipresent.github.io/btd6-modding-tutorial/).
2.  Make sure you open the game at least once before installing the plugin, so Melonloader can generate the nescessary files.
3.  Download [BTD6EpicGamesModCompat.dll](https://github.com/GrahamKracker/BTD6EpicGamesModCompat/releases/latest).
4.  Place it into  your `\EpicGames\BloonsTD6\Plugins` folder.
5.  Run the game, and you should be good to go.
